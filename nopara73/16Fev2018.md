# Confidential Transactions/Bulletproofs: The Elephant In The Room

In my previous article I deducted why and how Confidential Transactions/
Bulletproofs are revolutionary and how they will change Bitcoin for good.
However I conveniently ignored the elephant in the room, thus in this [article](https://github.com/InserirAquiNome/articles/blob/master/nopara73/10Fev2018.md) I
must correct myself, because as it is today, this technology will not get into
Bitcoin.


CT needs a soft fork and we will not have consensus for that.<br> There is a
tricky technical issue with Bulletproofs. From the
[whitepaper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf):

> Bulletproofs, like the range proofs currently used in confidential transactions,
> are computationally binding. An adversary that could break the discrete
logarithm assumption could generate acceptable range proofs for a value outside
the correct range…

> …An adversary that can break the binding property of the commitment scheme or
> the soundness of the proof system can generate coins out of thin air and thus
create uncontrolled but undetectable inflation rendering the currency useless…

> …While the discrete logarithm assumption is believed to hold for classical
> computers, it does not hold against a quantum adversary.

**Meaning: quantum computers could break Bulletproofs by creating silent
inflation.** This is fine for Monero or Mimblewimble, but this will not fly with
Bitcoin developers.

So will we see CT/Bulletproofs in Bitcoin, if so, when? This may sound
contradictory to this whole post, but I would speculate from 3 to 10 years we
will get some kind of sound amount hiding, call it Confidential Transactions,
Bulletproofs, Mimblezeroringshuffleproofs or something else . *I would be
surprised if this is the end of the road. Luckily, progress in technology
doesn’t tend to just stop.*
