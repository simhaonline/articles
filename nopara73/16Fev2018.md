# Confidential Transactions/Bulletproofs: The Elephant In The Room

In my previous article I deducted why and how Confidential Transactions/
Bulletproofs are revolutionary and how they will change Bitcoin for good.
However I conveniently ignored the elephant in the room, thus in this [article](https://github.com/InserirAquiNome/articles/blob/master/nopara73/10Fev2018.md) I
must correct myself, because as it is today, this technology will not get into
Bitcoin.


CT needs a soft fork and we will not have consensus for that.<br> There is a
tricky technical issue with Bulletproofs. From the
[whitepaper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf):

> Bulletproofs, like the range proofs currently used in confidential transactions,
> are computationally binding. An adversary that could break the discrete
logarithm assumption could generate acceptable range proofs for a value outside
the correct range…

> …An adversary that can break the binding property of the commitment scheme or
> the soundness of the proof system can generate coins out of thin air and thus
create uncontrolled but undetectable inflation rendering the currency useless…

> …While the discrete logarithm assumption is believed to hold for classical
> computers, it does not hold against a quantum adversary.

**Meaning: quantum computers could break Bulletproofs by creating silent
inflation.** This is fine for Monero or Mimblewimble, but this will not fly with
Bitcoin developers.

So will we see CT/Bulletproofs in Bitcoin, if so, when? This may sound
contradictory to this whole post, but I would speculate from 3 to 10 years we
will get some kind of sound amount hiding, call it Confidential Transactions,
Bulletproofs, Mimblezeroringshuffleproofs or something else . *I would be
surprised if this is the end of the road. Luckily, progress in technology
doesn’t tend to just stop.*

Curious why you say it would be fine for Monero or MimbleWimble (Grin)? My
understanding of MW was that pretty much the *only* thing the protocol reveals
is that there were no new coins created outside of whatever inflation mechanism
the protocol dictates. Are you saying this feature can be broken with quantum
computing?

You may be right, because I am not that much into it, but I doubt and here’s
why: MW was created regardless CT, which ensures the inflation protection.
However MW, or later Grin added CT so it can provide additional privacy. Then
Bulletproofs were invented and to my knowledge Grin uses Bulletproofs as is. MW
may rely on super strong crypto…

Ditto quantum computers being a risk for SHA256 but it lives in bitcoin. I agree
that any fork is next to impossible for consensus reasons but this reason alone
is likely not bulletproof’s nail in coffin.

I actually started this essay by talking about social issues, and came to the
conclusion that we can only push this change through if we have >80% developer
and researcher consensus. Then I deleted that first part and just left the less
speculative part of it here.
